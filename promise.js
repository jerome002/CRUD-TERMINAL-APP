// This code demonstrates how to create a promise in JavaScript.
// It creates a promise that simulates the delivery of a pizza.
// The promise is resolved if the pizza is ready, and rejected if it is not.
// The promise is created using the Promise constructor, which takes a function with two parameters: resolve and reject.
// The setTimeout function is used to simulate a delay of 2 seconds before resolving or rejecting the promise.
// The then method is used to handle the resolved value, and the catch method is used to handle the rejected value.
// The promise is created with a 2-second delay to simulate the time it takes for the pizza to be delivered.    
// The promise is resolved with a success message if the pizza is ready, and rejected with an error message if it is not.
// The promise is created with a 2-second delay to simulate the time it takes for the pizza to be delivered.
// The promise is resolved with a success message if the pizza is ready, and rejected with an error message if it is not.
