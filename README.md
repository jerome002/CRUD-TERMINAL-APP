## Overview

This repository serves as a hands-on learning resource for JavaScript programming. It encompasses various code snippets and a terminal-based CRUD application to illustrate fundamental and advanced JavaScript concepts.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Examples demonstrating callbacks, promises, and async/await patterns.
- **Function Implementations:** Various function examples to illustrate different use cases and syntax.
- **Terminal-Based CRUD App:** A simple contact manager application that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete contacts directly from the terminal.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jerome002/Javascript_programming.git

- **asyncAwait.js:** Demonstrates the use of async/await for handling asynchronous operations.
- **bankAccount.js:** Simulates basic banking operations to illustrate object-oriented programming concepts.
- **callback.js:** Shows how callbacks work in JavaScript.
- **crud_terminal_app.js:** A terminal-based application for managing contacts, showcasing CRUD operations.
- **functions.js:** Contains various function examples.
- **index.html & script.js:** Basic HTML and JavaScript files for browser-based demonstrations.
- **promise.js:** Illustrates the use of Promises for asynchronous operations.

## Usage

### Running the CRUD Terminal App

Ensure you are in the project directory.

Run the application:

```bash
node crud_terminal_app.js
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to add, view, update, or delete contacts.

### Exploring Other Examples

Run any of the JavaScript files using Node.js to see the output:

```bash
node filename.js
```

Replace `filename.js` with the name of the file you wish to execute.
